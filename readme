# 2025 Photobook Infrastructure Overview

This repository now contains the static assets that GitHub Pages will publish to `https://sc9photobook2025.com/`, along with the operational checklist for keeping the site live and up to date.

## Site Structure
- [`index.html`](index.html): Landing page for the photobook launch.
- [`assets/css/styles.css`](assets/css/styles.css): Global styling, layout, and responsive rules.
- [`assets/js/main.js`](assets/js/main.js): Renders the project timeline highlights on load.
- [`CNAME`](CNAME): Pins the custom domain configuration for GitHub Pages.
- [`docs/operations/web_infrastructure_plan.md`](docs/operations/web_infrastructure_plan.md): Domain registration, hosting pipeline configuration, HTTPS/CDN setup, and ongoing maintenance routines.

## How to Preview Locally
1. Install any static HTTP server (Python is preinstalled in most environments).
2. From the repository root, run `python -m http.server 4000`.
3. Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in a browser to view the site before deploying.

## GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist
- Push changes to the default branch so GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically.
- Confirm **Settings → Pages** is set to deploy from the root of the repository.
- Verify the custom domain reads `sc9photobook2025.com` and HTTPS is enforced.
- Ensure registrar DNS `A` records point to the four GitHub Pages IP addresses (`185.199.108.153` – `185.199.111.153`).

## Routine Tasks Summary
- **Monthly:** Refresh featured content, verify automated backups, and run link-check reports.
- **Annually:** Review hosting/CDN costs and confirm domain renewal and billing details.

Refer to the detailed plan for step-by-step guidance and escalation procedures.
