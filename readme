# 2025 Photobook Infrastructure Overview

This repository documents the operational checklist for launching and maintaining the 2025 Photobook web presence.

## Key Documentation
- [`docs/operations/web_infrastructure_plan.md`](docs/operations/web_infrastructure_plan.md): Domain registration, hosting pipeline configuration, HTTPS/CDN setup, and ongoing maintenance routines.

## Live Site
- Production URL: [http://sc9photobook2025.com/](http://sc9photobook2025.com/)
- Hosting: GitHub Pages with the custom domain set in the repository's **Settings → Pages** configuration.
- Action items:
  - Commit a `CNAME` file containing `sc9photobook2025.com` so GitHub Pages remembers the domain.
  - Point registrar DNS `A` records to the GitHub Pages IPs (`185.199.108.153` – `185.199.111.153`).
  - After DNS propagates, enable "Enforce HTTPS" in GitHub Pages settings to redirect to `https://sc9photobook2025.com/`.

## Routine Tasks Summary
- **Monthly:** Refresh featured content, verify automated backups, and run link-check reports.
- **Annually:** Review hosting/CDN costs and confirm domain renewal and billing details.

Refer to the detailed plan for step-by-step guidance and escalation procedures.
