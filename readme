# 2025 Photobook Infrastructure Overview

This repository hosts the static site that GitHub Pages publishes to
[`https://sc9photobook2025.com/`](https://sc9photobook2025.com/). It also keeps the
operational checklist for maintaining the live experience.

## Site Structure
- [`index.html`](index.html): Minimal landing card that introduces the SC9 Photo Book 2025 experience.
- [`style.css`](style.css): Dark theme styling, layout rules, and responsive behaviour for the landing card.
- [`script.js`](script.js): Handles the page fade-in animation and logs the load event.
- [`CNAME`](CNAME): Custom-domain binding for GitHub Pages.
- [`docs/operations/web_infrastructure_plan.md`](docs/operations/web_infrastructure_plan.md): Domain registration, hosting pipeline configuration, HTTPS/CDN setup, and ongoing maintenance routines.

## How to Preview Locally
1. Install any static HTTP server (Python is preinstalled in most environments).
2. From the repository root, run `python -m http.server 4000`.
3. Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in a browser to verify the landing card renders correctly before deploying.

## Editing the Landing Page
- Update the headline or tagline in `index.html` to reflect the latest story for the photobook.
- Tweak colours, spacing, or hover treatments in `style.css` to match evolving art direction.
- Extend `script.js` if you need additional lightweight interactions on the landing card.

## GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist
- Push changes to the `main` branch so GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically from the repository root.
- Confirm **Settings → Pages** is set to deploy from the `main` branch and the `/` directory.
- Verify the custom domain reads `sc9photobook2025.com` and HTTPS is enforced.
- Ensure registrar DNS `A` records point to the four GitHub Pages IP addresses (`185.199.108.153` – `185.199.111.153`).

## Routine Tasks Summary
- **Monthly:** Refresh copy or imagery references, verify automated backups, and run link-check reports.
- **Annually:** Review hosting/CDN costs and confirm domain renewal and billing details.

Refer to the detailed plan for step-by-step guidance and escalation procedures.
