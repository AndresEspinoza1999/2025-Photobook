# 2025 Photobook Infrastructure Overview

This repository hosts the static site that GitHub Pages publishes to
[`https://sc9photobook2025.com/`](https://sc9photobook2025.com/). It also keeps the
operational checklist for maintaining the live experience.

## Site Structure
- [`index.html`](index.html): Interactive photobook skeleton with page-turn navigation and placeholder spreads.
- [`assets/css/styles.css`](assets/css/styles.css): Global styling for the site shell and the 3D book effect.
- [`assets/js/main.js`](assets/js/main.js): Controls page flips, keyboard navigation, and status messaging.
- [`CNAME`](CNAME): Custom-domain binding for GitHub Pages.
- [`docs/operations/web_infrastructure_plan.md`](docs/operations/web_infrastructure_plan.md): Domain registration, hosting pipeline configuration, HTTPS/CDN setup, and ongoing maintenance routines.

## How to Preview Locally
1. Install any static HTTP server (Python is preinstalled in most environments).
2. From the repository root, run `python -m http.server 4000`.
3. Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in a browser to review the page-turn animation before deploying.

## Editing the Photobook Skeleton
- Duplicate an existing `<div class="page">` block in `index.html` to add new spreads, updating the `data-summary` attribute and placeholder text.
- Adjust colors, textures, or layout guides in `assets/css/styles.css` to match the evolving art direction.
- Use `assets/js/main.js` if you need to customise navigation behaviour (e.g., locking certain spreads during reviews).

## GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist
- Push changes to the default branch so GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically.
- Confirm **Settings → Pages** is set to deploy from the root of the repository.
- Verify the custom domain reads `sc9photobook2025.com` and HTTPS is enforced.
- Ensure registrar DNS `A` records point to the four GitHub Pages IP addresses (`185.199.108.153` – `185.199.111.153`).

## Routine Tasks Summary
- **Monthly:** Refresh spreads with new photography, verify automated backups, and run link-check reports.
- **Annually:** Review hosting/CDN costs and confirm domain renewal and billing details.

Refer to the detailed plan for step-by-step guidance and escalation procedures.
